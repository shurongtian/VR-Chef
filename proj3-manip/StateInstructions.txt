We have several states such as
picking up food,
picking up knife,
holding dial on oven,
chopping with knife,
food being chopped,
rotating dial,
can select nearby object,
and dropping whatever is grabbed.

These states have a visual change,
the nearby objects turn blue with a yellow highlight,
the knife turns red when it is brought down in a chopping motion,
the tomato turns yellow if it is touched by the knife when the knife is red to show it is now cut,
the dial can be rotated when it is grabbed,
the grabbed object such as knife or tomato can also be dropped or swatted away with the hands or other objects.
